The integration with OpenAI involves processing menu photos, likely using GPT-4 Vision for text extraction and recommendation generation, based on user preferences stored in the database.

#### Integration and Security Considerations

- **Database Normalization with Supabase:** The models should be designed with normalized relationships, avoiding redundancy. For example, a `User` entity might have a one-to-many relationship with `Recommendation`, ensuring data integrity and efficiency.
- **OpenAI Integration:** The backend uses OpenAI API, particularly GPT-4 Vision, to process menu images. This involves extracting text from photos and generating recommendations, requiring `OpenAIUtils.java` to handle API calls, potentially using base64 encoding for image data.
- **Security:** Implements JWT for authentication, with `SecurityConfig.java` validating tokens. OWASP Top 10, especially SQL injection, is mitigated by using parameterized queries in JPA, ensuring secure database operations.

#### Testing Strategy

- Unit tests with JUnit for backend services and controllers ensure functionality, with examples like testing `MenuService` for menu processing and `AuthController` for authentication endpoints.

#### Unexpected Detail: OpenAI Image Processing

An interesting aspect is the use of OpenAI for image processing, particularly with GPT-4 Vision, which can handle menu photo analysis. This capability, not immediately obvious, enhances the application's AI-driven recommendations, potentially surprising users expecting traditional text-based inputs.

#### Tables for Clarity

            client-secret: YOUR_GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET
            scope: openid, profile, email
```

---

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Enable OAuth in Spring Security (JWT Only)**
```java
@Configuration
@EnableWebSecurity
public class SecurityConfig {
    @Bean
    public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
        http
            .csrf(AbstractHttpConfigurer::disable) // REST API - No CSRF
            .sessionManagement(session -> session.sessionCreationPolicy(SessionCreationPolicy.STATELESS)) // No sessions
            .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
                .requestMatchers("/public/**").permitAll() // Public endpoints
                .requestMatchers("/users/**").authenticated()
                .requestMatchers("/workers/**").hasRole("WORKER")
                .anyRequest().authenticated()
            )
            .oauth2Login(withDefaults()) // Enable OAuth login
            .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt); // Validate JWT tokens

        return http.build();
    }
}
```

---

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Configure JWT Validation (Google‚Äôs Public Keys)**
Google issues **JWT tokens** that your backend must verify.  
Google‚Äôs **JWKS endpoint** (`https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs`) provides public keys to validate these tokens.

```java
@Bean
public JwtDecoder jwtDecoder() {
    return NimbusJwtDecoder.withJwkSetUri("https://www.googleapis.com/oauth2/v3/certs").build();
}
```

---

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Implement Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**
Since your **workers and users** have different permissions:

```java
@Bean
public SecurityFilterChain securityFilterChain(HttpSecurity http) throws Exception {
    http
        .authorizeHttpRequests(auth -> auth
            .requestMatchers("/users/**").authenticated()
            .requestMatchers("/workers/**").hasAuthority("ROLE_WORKER")
            .anyRequest().authenticated()
        )
        .oauth2ResourceServer(OAuth2ResourceServerConfigurer::jwt);

    return http.build();
}
```
